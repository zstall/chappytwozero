# Update Chappy app
Chappy now uses sqlite for a db and has some api functionality. Will need to do some more cleanup here, but wanted to get the ball rolling.

## Step 1: Create a virtual environment
With python3 create 
- python3 -m venv venv
- pip install twilio
- pip install flask
- pip install flask-restful

## Step 2: Create Database for Chappy:
- Edit your all_chores.csv to add or subtract chores. 
- Currently setup for daily and weekly chores
- Edit createChappyDB and add users. Can set any number of users
- When ready run: python createChappyDB.py

## Step 3: Setup twilio
- [Review twilio setup here](https://github.com/zstall/chapp)
- Update config.py file with twilio account info

## Step 4: Test chap.py
- Run chap.py comes in debug mode. Will output chores and people to command line
- Run with : python chap.py
- Turn off debug mode to send messages via twilio:
    - Set trace to False

## Step 5: Test fchap.py and api calls
- Run python fchap.py
- Will have a local host can run two api calls:
    - Mark chore done in DB: /choredone/<chr_name>
    - Reset daily or weekly chores: /resetchores/<sched>
